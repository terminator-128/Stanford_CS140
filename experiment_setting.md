### Pintos Projects
	This class includes four programming projects based on the Pintos operating system. For these projects you will work in teams of two or three. The Pintos projects take quite a bit of time, so we recommend that you choose your teammates and get started as soon as possible. Before starting on any of the projects you should read the following Pintos materials:

### Pintos introduction
	Coding standards
	Project documentation
	How to submit Pintos projects for grading

### Project 1: Threads

	Additional notes and modifications for Project 1:

	A common mistake students make throughout the Pintos projects is to use malloc carelessly. If you call malloc, you must check the result to make sure the system did not run out of memory (and you must do something reasonable if memory does run out). In addition, you must be sure that any memory you allocate is eventually freed.
